                    <h2>Introduction </h2>
                    <p>In my time in this module I have seen progress in my skills like writing codes, developing a
                        website etc. When building this website I faced some difficulties like making my columns in my
                        index page but was still able to find solutions to them.</p>

                    <h2>How I made my website </h2>
                    <p>I was inspired by looking through a few websites(roxo-hugo.staticmania.com) that I had searched
                        and now decided how I wanted mine to look, the kind of design it should have, the font that
                        should be applied. This was my first time developing a website so I had to make sure I was doing
                        it right. When designing my website I went through some background pages and saw the kind of
                        images they used and decided that mine should also be professional and interesting to I went to
                        one of the best sites(istockphoto.com) where I found the background image that I wanted for my
                        pages.</p>

                    <h2>Progress on the website </h2>
                    <p>The picture below is my progress on the website and how far I have gone, I made some few changes
                        to some pages like the design, style, colour and background image at the end of developing my
                        website. However my design decisions all came from my head and was drawn down in a book before
                        proceeding to developing the website so I know what I am about to do and you can also find
                        pictures of the drawings below.</p>

                    <h2>Validation of my pages</h2>
                    <p>I had so make some changes so some of my code after running it through validation and found some
                        error in some of the code I had written. So below are the screenshots of the errors and
                        screenshots that show my code validates.</p>
